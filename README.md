# backend-ai-roadmap
M0: Basecamp (Week 0 – Foundation Setup)
Goal: Get a rock-solid dev environment running with one command, ensuring reproducibility and git best practices. This phase eliminates setup friction for everything that follows.
Key Skills: Git advanced (rebase, squash, signed commits); Docker (multi-stage builds, BuildKit caching); VS Code Dev Containers for isolated, hot-reloading setups.
Deliverable: Repo dev-toolkit with a make dev command that spins up a containerized environment (linting, hot reload).
Public Proof: README screenshot showing green CI badge and Dev Container badge.
Week Mapping: Purely Week 0—install tools (Docker, VS Code, GitHub CLI, AWS CLI, Terraform), create the main repo (backend-ai-roadmap), and push a hello-world container. This sets up for FastAPI in Week 1.
Tips: If you're on Windows/Mac, enable Docker's WSL2 for better perf. Test the container locally before pushing. Time: 5-10 hrs total—quick win to build confidence.
M1: Rock-Solid Backend (Weeks 1-6 – Core API Building)
Goal: Build a performant, secure backend service with database, caching, auth, and testing—focusing on handling real traffic without breaking.
Key Skills: Advanced Python (async, Pydantic); FastAPI (dependencies, middleware, tasks); Postgres (indexes, RLS, partitioning); Redis (caching, rate-limiting); OAuth2/JWT (RBAC); Alembic migrations; Pytest with 100% coverage; 75 LeetCode problems (arrays, trees, etc.).
Deliverable: Repo url-shrinker-pro—URL shortener with user analytics, RBAC, and Locust-tested for 1k RPS.
Public Proof: Postman collection; Load-test GIF (1k RPS <50ms p95).
Week Mapping:
Week 1: FastAPI basics + pytest/coverage.
Week 2: Add Next.js frontend + Docker Compose (API, web, DB stack).
Week 3: Postgres/RLS + Redis caching.
Week 4: GitHub Actions CI (lint/test/build/push) + badge.
Week 5: Integrate promptfoo for toxicity filter (early AI touch).
Week 6: Locust load-test GIF + Terraform AWS ECS deploy; Blog post #1.
Tips: Use FastAPI's tutorial link to bootstrap. Focus on async for perf—test early with real data. If LeetCode feels grindy, do 10-15/week themed around data structures. Checkpoint: Done by Oct 13, 2025.
M2: AI-Glue Micro-Services (Weeks 7-10 – AI Integration)
Goal: Glue AI APIs into your backend for intelligent features like search and processing, with queuing and cost controls.
Key Skills: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (streaming, token counting); LangChain (chains, memory); Prompt engineering/eval (promptfoo); Vector DBs (pgvector/Pinecone); Celery queues; Cost tracking; GPU/serverless routing.
Deliverable: Monorepo ai-pipeline-suite with toxicity filter, semantic search (50k arXiv abstracts), and async LLM worker.
Public Proof: Grafana dashboard (tokens/sec, costs); Blog post on cheap moderation at scale.
Week Mapping:
Week 7: pgvector + embeddings; Vue search playground.
Week 8: Terraform GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for multi-cloud.
Week 9: Celery/Redis + Claude API; Grafana setup.
Week 10: AWS Budget alerts; Blog post #2.
Tips: Use the pgvector GitHub link for install—start with free-tier Neon.tech DB. Experiment with prompts via promptfoo.dev to optimize costs. This phase shifts you into "AI-native" dev. Checkpoint: Done by Dec 8, 2025.
M3: Platform & Infra (Weeks 11-14 – Scalable Deployment)
Goal: Automate infrastructure as code for secure, multi-env deploys—moving from local to cloud-scale.
Key Skills: Terraform (VPC, RDS, ECS, IAM); Multi-arch Docker; GitHub Actions (OIDC to AWS); Secrets management; Blue/green/canary deploys; OWASP security hardening.
Deliverable: Repo infra-live—Terraform spins up full stack in 5 min (staging/prod).
Public Proof: Terraform apply/destroy GIF (<5 min); Snyk security badge.
Week Mapping:
Week 11: K8s basics (minikube) + Helm for url-shrinker.
Week 12: EKS (AWS K8s) + Argo CD.
Week 13: React UI for monitoring; Chaos Mesh experiment.
Week 14: Argo Rollouts for canary; 2-min demo video.
Tips: Leverage Terraform AWS registry link for modules. Use student credits to avoid costs—set budgets early. K8s.io tutorial is key here; start small with minikube. Checkpoint: Done by Feb 16, 2026 (includes demo video on YouTube).
M4: Observability & SRE (Weeks 15-20 – Reliability Engineering)
Goal: Add monitoring, alerts, and resilience so your systems self-heal and you can debug production issues.
Key Skills: Prometheus/Grafana (metrics/alerts); OpenTelemetry tracing; Structured logging; SLO/SLI calcs; Chaos testing.
Deliverable: Repo observability-stack—SLO example (99% <200ms); Chaos run with recovery metrics.
Public Proof: Grafana snapshot link; Incident runbook Markdown.
Week Mapping:
Week 15: Stripe billing + multi-tenant design.
Week 16: Unleash feature flags + A/B dashboard.
Week 17: Open-source PR + pair-programming mock.
Week 18: System-design mock.
Week 19: AWS Developer Associate exam + LinkedIn badge.
Week 20: Runbook template; Blog post #3.
Tips: Grafana Cloud link for free tier setup. Practice chaos on non-prod envs. Cert exam preps you for interviews—use free AWS resources. Checkpoint: Done by Mar 30, 2026.
M5: Capstone & Internship Signal (Weeks 21-24 – Production & Career Launch)
Goal: Build a full AI SaaS product, add business features, and signal readiness for roles/internships.
Key Skills: Multi-tenant SaaS (auth, flags); Billing (Stripe metering); A/B testing; Tech writing/talks; Mock interviews.
Deliverable: Repo studyforge-ai—AI doc summarizer/flashcard/quiz app with Stripe tiers and referrals.
Public Proof: Live prod URL (with wait-list); Customer quotes; AWS cert badges.
Week Mapping:
Week 21: Resume update + DM recruiters.
Week 22: Internship apps wave #1 + calls.
Week 23: Apps wave #2 + negotiation practice.
Week 24: Full review + celebrate.
Tips: Stripe docs for usage billing. Make the app open-source friendly for contribs. Use Pramp for mocks. This phase turns your work into a job magnet—aim for 3-5 apps/week. Checkpoint: Done by May 11, 2026.
This phased approach ensures progressive mastery while keeping things fun and proof-oriented. If you hit roadblocks (e.g., tool installs), ping for specific advice—what's your starting experience level?
